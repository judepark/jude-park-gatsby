> "If you think good design is expensive, you should look at the cost of bad design." <br> - Ralf Speth

During my masters, a founder spoke about her failures that made me decide I wanted to study fairness in design.

She had created app that lets parents find babysitters based on their location. A standard practice in any geo-location feature, is to default the view settings by locality. However, after a few years she noticed a pain point in her users: Babysitters who lived in marginalized or remote areas were not getting jobs. 

Unintentionally, she had promoted babysitters who lived in richer neighborhoods to be matched with willing customers. User research informed her that the babysitters who lived farther away were more than willing to travel for work, and babysitters from undesirable neighborhods were no less qualified than the babysitters who lived in upper-class neighborhoods.

Did it make sense to set the default settings to view babysitters closest to you? Was that the most important criteria for parents looking for babysitters? Was the app discriminating users based on where they lived?

> How do you solve a social issue through design?

This sparked a passion in me to try to design products deliver fair service. Technology pervades our lives in every aspect, and I wanted to create a fairer and a more sustainable future, by designing new products and services *right*[^1]. When we elevate our collective understanding of ethical designs and fair access, we are better equipped for good designs. 


## Designers Shape The Future

A designer is someone who invents or develops something with intention. I believe designers build the world we have come to know and they will continue to shape our expectations. As such, they set the bar of what is socially acceptable or not. I hold designers accountable for at least being mindful of their biases. Beyond accessibility, inclusive or ethical design practices, there is a lack of understanding among designers when it comes to social privileges[^2]. I wanted to create a way for designers to first realize not all persons are born equal, and learn how design can actively solve the inequalities in users who have different social privileges. 

> How can we design fair products?

There are various design methodologies and tools that either prevents harmful design practices or can fix bad designs. Participatory or Co-Design frameworks, Design Thinking, all work to incorporate user feedbacks earlier in product strategy to prevent creating an unusuable products and services. Accessibility and inclusive design frameworks, and user testings can make products and services become more accessible for a particular group of users. 

But users are not just "users" who interacts with an interface. They are human, with identities and social privileges that can determine how they interact with a product or service. When designers are mindful about the fact that not all users that come to their products will not have an equal experience 

## People are not Test Dummies

People are not test dummies, mass produced and homogenous.


For my thesis I researched design methodologies (eg. Design Thinking vs. Participatory Design vs. Inclusive Design, ect.), looking at their history, applications, strengths and weaknesses. I wanted to answer the question: "How do you solve a social issue through design?" My 50 page paper really just boiled down to three points: 


1. **Designers, like all humans, are inherently biased due to the limitations of our own experiences.**
2. **Designers should not accidently produce something harmful.**
3. **Designers need a way to measure how accessible their products are to users of different social privileges in order to determine their social accessibility.**

[^1]: Fully acknowledging "right" is subjective, making something right is ethically a difficult concept. 

[^2]: Social Privileges include identities that is considered advantageous in society based on social class, gender, age, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, religion, accents, political group, physical and mental abilities, height, physical appearance, ect.
