> "If you think good design is expensive, you should look at the cost of bad design." <br> - Ralf Speth

Too often in government, UX is treated as a checkbox to report up that some form of user experience work has been done as a requirement. Unfortunately, this means that no proper investigation into the users and their feedbacks have been incorporately into the project lifecycle.

Project or product management nowadays emphasizes user experience more than ever before. While this is generally considered to be a good thing, since it implies digital products and services are more user friendly, the reality is that many project leads do not properly understand user experience and therefore end up treating it like a checkbox.

The UX checkbox is one of the most dangerous attitudes a project lead could have ever regarding their project.

Usually what happens, due to external pressures to create user-friendly products, is that the leaders hear about user experience and think yeah that sounds like a great thing to add to my project! Everyone else is doing it! User Experience means you think about the user's experience right? Right on! Lets hire a UX professional contrator to bring a more User Experience aspect to our project.

What they end up doing is treating UX as a simple checkbox.

The checkbox they have in their mind looks like this:

When really, it should look like this: 


Too often, UX is treated as a singular checkbox in the project. We hired a UX person on this project, therefore we can ensure this prodcut is UX-friendly.

This is not true! 



When we treat these ux checklists, or targets in projects, we are dehumanizing the process of actually thinking about people.

solving issues involves facing your won demons, it is uncomfortable and we don't have the self reflective tools to navigate that - so everything turns into lip service


another hazard about assumptions: Assuming that someone else has taken care of it (e.g. when using a tool/template from someone else. even from a company dedicated to inclusive design! they may have gaps!)

There actualy isn't a lot of people out there who truly understands accessibility, because most designers are able bodied
