##Introduction

For some companies, remote usability testing wasn't a new concept. But for many, the shift was sudden and dramatic. When you start to conduct user tests from afar, you need to make sure that you're creating a solid plan in advance and keeping an open mind during the test itself. Unfortunately, we've noticed that some teams are making plenty of mistakes that can be avoided with a little extra preparation. To help out, here are five common mistakes we see when it comes to conducting virtual research:

##Don't Assume People Will Show Up Or Stay

In a remote research setting, the researcher is making a lot of assumptions:

* People will show up.

* They'll actually follow instructions.

* They'll do things the way you want them to.

* Plan out every activity, including technical difficulties

When it comes to remote research, you're going to encounter some technical difficulties. This can range from issues with the camera or microphone (you'll have a better shot at getting good audio if you test out those tools prior to your session) to connectivity problems between the participant and their device. It's important that you prepare for these issues by planning out what your next steps are if they arise—even though it may seem obvious now, when you're in the moment, it won't be as easy as it sounds.

##Don't try to test for everything at once

It's important to remember that you can't test for everything at once. You don't need a participant to evaluate your app from every possible angle, so focus on the most important issues first and then move on from there. For example, if you're testing a mobile app and want to make sure it works well in all sorts of different situations (like when someone is using it while walking down the street), then maybe don't start off by asking them about how easy it is for someone driving over 60 mph to use the phone while driving their car—that would be exhausting!

##Don't be afraid to adapt to changes in research multiple times

You will encounter changes during the course of your research. Some changes may be small and others significant. You need to be flexible, adaptable and open-minded as changes happen.

A change in schedule with your participants: There are many reasons why this can happen including work commitments, illness or personal issues. When this happens it’s important that you are flexible enough to reschedule for another time when the participant is available rather than holding on too tightly to a specific date & time slot.

* A change in the research process: Sometimes there are unexpected results from previous stages of your research which may require a change in how you conduct future stages (i.e., if your interviews have uncovered some interesting insights that suggest you need more qualitative data).

* Your participant has an unexpected conflict in schedule - For example: getting a call or an emergency. Remember that they are here to volunteer their time out of their busy schedule - be expected to reschedule and always have alternative times to offer.

##Remember that you are designing for real people — not just numbers and analytics

UX is not just about numbers and analytics. It’s not even just about the user experience, which can be measured in many ways. UX is about empathy, understanding and human behavior.

The best way to understand and improve a user’s experience is to understand them emotionally, physically and mentally. You need to see how they react when presented with your design concepts or prototypes — how they navigate through them and what their thoughts are as they do so.

##Virtual user testing is a challenge, but it can be done successfully

Although virtual user testing is a challenge, it can be done successfully. Research participants are a little more difficult to control and get the most out of them when they're in a lab, but you'll need to accept that some things will be out of your hands. You may have to change your research multiple times due to technical difficulties or changes in the users' circumstances.

Be prepared for this possibility!

##Conclusion

In conclusion, even though conducting remote user research may seem like a difficult and daunting task, it is not impossible. However, the most important thing to remember is that this process requires flexibility and an open mind. There is no one right way to do remote UX research; there are many depending on your needs as a company or an individual.



Do not double the amount of the work for the participants by making it a learn a new tech session (This means, no Miro, No Airtable, protect the participants from learning/interacting with a new technology as much as possible.

1. Do not assume they know the tech

2. Do not make overtly prompt them, it should be a natural process

3. Think of Accessibilty (Small fonts, small screens, sharing your screen will not mean everyone is able to read what is on the screen.)

4. NO last minute project management! This is a message for the leaders; do not make your team hurry last minute to make a session happen. 

3. Personality is important
