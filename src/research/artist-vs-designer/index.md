> "The purpose of an artist is the expression of their ideas. The purpose of a designer is function, first and foremost."


When I first began working as a User Experience Designer, almost everyone around me thought that meant I was a graphic artist. To this day, people still treat me like an artist. "Hey Jude, can you help me with the logo design?" "Hey Jude, can you help make this slide deck pretty?" "Hey Jude, does this *look* good to you?"

People often do not understand the distinction between an artist and a designer. What does it mean to design, vs. being an artist? 

> Function, First and Foremost

The purpose of an artist is the expression of their ideas. The purpose of a designer is function, first and foremost. A designer creates to communicate function to the user.
